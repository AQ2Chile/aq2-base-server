Action Quake2 - Base Server Installer by Paul Klumpp (2012-11-18)

It's always the same in Linux: To make it work on your system, some quake2 
stuff needs to be compiled. Please follow these simple instructions.

First, on Linux, be an unprivileged user. The following will create a
"aq2-basesrv" directory, so, there is no need to create a new directory.
Just start the the magic script by:

  curl -L https://bitbucket.org/PaulKlumpp/aq2-basesrv/raw/ba723ec3be9c076971152da77b9bd274abb53e8f/q2compile/aq2-bsrv-pkg.sh | bash -s first


For future updates, start this:

  curl -L https://bitbucket.org/PaulKlumpp/aq2-basesrv/raw/ba723ec3be9c076971152da77b9bd274abb53e8f/q2compile/aq2-bsrv-pkg.sh | bash -s update


Note: These magic scripts will install or update everything, but they 
      won't overwrite your changes on configuration files.

===============================================================================

Now, to your job! Your job is to configure your server, so read the
following steps carefully and learn something.


Change to your q2 server directory:

	cd aq2-basesrv/q2srv/


Edit the gs_starter.cfg and try to study what it says:

	nano gs_starter.cfg 

	Note: The ACTIVATE variable defines which instances get run 
	      by ./gs_starter.sh startwatch. And obviously, the rest of the 
	      variables define starting parameters for these instances.


Edit action/h_passwords.cfg so you have a rcon_password that you actually know:

	nano action/h_passwords.cfg


Start the gs_starter.sh script... With default gs_starter.cfg, it will watch 
over your Action Quake 2 game server instances 1, 2 and 3:

	screen ./gs_starter.sh startwatch


IT'S DONE. YOU'RE READY TO GO!
But if you're new to Linux and "screen", you have to know the following!


You can get a list of running gameserver instances with:

	screen -ls


You can attach to a running gameserver instance with:

	screen -x gs1
	or
	screen -x gs2   etc.


You can detach from a gameserver instance with:

	Press  ctrl+a  then  press d


You can kill ALL instances with:

	./gs_starter.sh stopall
	Note: If they were watched by startwatch, the instances will come up again.


You can kill an instance X with:

	./gs_starter.sh stop X
	Note: If it was watched by startwatch, the instance will come up again.


You can start an instance X with:

	./gs_starter.sh start X
	Note: This does not necessarily mean that this instance is watched.


You can stop watching the instances with:

	./gs_starter.sh stopwatch


For help, just start it:

	./gs_starter.sh


And now, have fun!
